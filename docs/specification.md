### Code Deployment Integrity

*** Disclaimer: This is an experimental feature. Not ready for production use!! ***

The origins of contracts, especially those built by remote
toolchains, may be difficult to trace. Our Code Deployment
Integrity (CDI) framework, enables PDO enclave hosting services
(eservice) to specify various levels of trust relationships
with contract build toolchains,
and establish trust in contracts at run-time based on their policy.

For normal CDI policies, CDI-aware toolchains digitally sign
the emitted contract code to authenticate the toolchain. For
strict CDO policies, toolchains may generate a signed cryptographic
proof binding the input to the emitted contract code.
Only if the eservice can validate the provenance and integrity
of the contract it receives, does it execute the contract.

To develop using docker, you will have to install a recent version of
the `docker` daemon, _including build-kit_, and you also need
`docker-compose`. On ubuntu, the easiest way is to achieve that is to
run `sudo apt install docker docker-buildx docker-compose`. For other
platforms or more recent versions, see the [official docker
site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).   See also the
official documentation for any [post-install
steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/),
e.g., configuring it with systemd and/or to work with a proxy

For usage of docker, see the [PDO Docker README](../docker/README.md).

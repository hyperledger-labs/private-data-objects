# Instructions to Build and Install Private Data Objects

Private Data Objects (PDO) can be installed directly to a host system or
it may be installed through Docker. This document contains instructions
for both methods of installation. If you choose to install directly on a
host system, please clone our repo with the following command to pull
in all submodules:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/private-data-objects.git
```

PDO requires installation of the SDK for Intel Software Guard Extensions
(SGX). SGX can be used either in simulation mode or hardware
mode. Simulation mode will work even when there is no processor support
for SGX. However, simulation mode is not secure and is suitable soley
for development and demonstration. Hardware mode, which uses trusted
execution capabilities in the processor to protect confidentiality and
integrity of computation, requires appropriate processor
support. Information about supported processors is provided below.

## Recommended Host System

The required host-system configuration for Private Data Objects is to
separate the Private Data Objects components from the ledger components.

Private Data Objects services (specifically the enclave service, provisioning
service, and the client) can be run on Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04
(server or client).
PDO also has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 17.10. However, for these
configuration not all standard libraries match the required versions and
you will have to, e.g., install by hand an openssl version >= 1.1.0g
(the default libssl-dev on these platforms is still based on 1.0.2).

If you want to run PDO on a single physical host, either PDO or the
ledger will have to run in a separate VM or container. In particular, to run
PDO in SGX HW mode, the PDO component has to run in an SGX-enabled
environment. Below installation and configuration instructions will make
sure that the host and the docker components fullfill this requirement.

If Sawtooth ledger is used, then both Sawtooth (and the PDO transaction
processors for Sawtooth) should be run on Ubuntu 16.04. If Microsoft CCF
ledger is used, both CCF and the PDO transaction processor should be run
on Ubuntu 18.04.
We provide Docker images to run the ledger in the supported environment.

The ledger and PDO may run on other Linux distributions, but the installation
process is likely to be more complicated, and the use of other
distributions is not supported by their respective communities at this time.

### Overview

Private Data Objects uses the trusted execution capabilities provided by
Intel SGX to protect integrity and confidentiality. More information
about SGX can be found on the
[Intel SGX website](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx).

SGX can operate in either simulation mode or hardware mode. Simulation
mode does not require any processor support for SGX and can be useful
for development and testing. However, simulation mode does not provide
any protection for confidential data and does not guarantee integrity of
execution. To use SGX in simulation mode set the `SGX_MODE` environment
variable to `SIM`:

```bash
export SGX_MODE=SIM
```

SGX hardware mode uses capabilities for trusted execution in the
processor to protect confidentiality and integrity of computation. SGX
hardware mode requires processor support for SGX
([commonly available on recent Intel processors](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/search/featurefilter.html)).
PDO currently relies on EPID-based SGX attestation, which is supported
on all SGX-enabled hardware (including FLC-enabled hardware).

To use SGX in hardware mode set the `SGX_MODE` environment variable to
`HW`:

```bash
export SGX_MODE=HW
```

The remainder of this section provides information about preparing to run
Private Data Objects using SGX in hardware mode. Specifically, there
are steps that must be taken to enable attestation of the hardware
platform using the Intel Attestation Service (IAS).

### SGX in Hardware Mode

#### Update the BIOS

It may be advisable to update your BIOS to pick up any recent
patches. For example, if you want to run PDO on an Intel NUC, you can
visit the
[Intel Download Center](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)
(and select `Mini PCs`) to find the latest BIOS release. Other vendors
may provide similar updates.

Note: If the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of the platform performing an
attestation is outdated, IAS can still verify an attestation; however,
the verification may include a `GROUP_OUT_OF_DATE` or
`CONFIGURATION_NEEDED` quote status. It is up to the verifier to decide
whether to trust an attestation from a platform whose TCB has been
identified as outdated. Note that PDO will flag this situation with a
warning.

#### Create an IAS Authentication Key

Access to IAS requires that a service provider create an identity (SPID)
and a client authentication key. To create the SPID and the key you
first need to register with the
[Intel Developer Portal](https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/developer).

Once your registration is complete subscribe for a
[linkable quote](https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/EPID-attestation)
to create the client authentication key. The key will be available from
your profile page.

Now organize your data as follows under the `${PDO_SGX_KEY_ROOT}` folder
(the default folder is `${PDO_SOURCE_ROOT}/build/keys/sgx_mode_${SGX_MODE,,}`,
or you can define yours with `export PDO_SGX_KEY_ROOT=<your folder>`):
* save your SPID in `${PDO_SGX_KEY_ROOT}/sgx_spid_api_key.txt`
* save your API key in `${PDO_SGX_KEY_ROOT}/sgx_spid_api_key.txt`
* save the IAS root CA certificate in `${PDO_SGX_KEY_ROOT}/sgx_ias_key.pem`
  (`wget https://certificates.trustedservices.intel.com/Intel_SGX_Attestation_RootCA.pem -O ${PDO_SGX_KEY_ROOT}/sgx_ias_key.pem`)

#### Install the SGX Kernel Driver (Hardware Support)

SGX can run in either simulation or hardware mode. No kernel driver is
required to run in simulation mode. However, if you plan to run with SGX
hardware support, it is necessary to install the SGX kernel driver.
Depending on your particular hardware, you will have to install
different drivers.

##### HW with support for DCAP / Flexible Launch Control (FLC)
<!-- DCAP kernel driver installation -->
The following commands will download and install the driver version 1.41 of
the DCAP SGX kernel driver (for Ubuntu 18.04 server):

```bash
UBUNTU_VERS=18.04 or 20.04
DRIVER_REPO=https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.15.1/distro/ubuntu${UBUNTU_VERS}-server/
DRIVER_FILE=sgx_linux_x64_driver_1.41.bin

wget ${DRIVER_REPO}/${DRIVER_FILE} -P /tmp
chmod a+x /tmp/${DRIVER_FILE}
sudo ./${DRIVER_FILE}
```
Note:
- the DCAP driver will _not_ work if your hardware does not supports FLC (Flexible Launch Control).
- the DCAP driver supports DKMS, so contrary to the sdk driver, you will _not_ have to re-install
  the kernel driver after each kernel update.


##### HW which does not support Flexible Launch Control (FLC)
<!-- SDK kernel driver installation -->

The following commands will download and install the SDK driver version
2.11 of the SGX kernel driver:
```bash
UBUNTU_VERS=18.04 or 20.04
DRIVER_REPO=https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.15.1/distro/ubuntu${UBUNTU_VERS}-server
DRIVER_FILE=ssgx_linux_x64_driver_2.11.0_2d2b795.bin

wget ${DRIVER_REPO}/${DRIVER_FILE} -P /tmp
chmod a+x /tmp/${DRIVER_FILE}
sudo ./${DRIVER_FILE}
```

Note:
- as of August 2020, the sdk drivers will cause BUS errors in some circumstance on FLC HW and PDO is currently not supported in that configuration.
- above installs the kernel module for the currently running kernel. You will have to reinstall the kernel driver once you boot into a new kernel.


#### Validating HW mode

To validate that your SGX HW installation & and corresponding PDO
configuration is working properly, the  easiest way is to install
docker as discussed below and then run
```bash
	make SGX_MODE=HW -C docker test
```
This will build PDO and automatically execute the tests described in
the Section [Validate the Installation](usage.md#validating) in HW mode.
Without docker, just define the SGX_MODE environment variable to
hardware mode (`export SGX_MODE=HW`) and manually follow the steps in
that section.


## Configuration

PDO uses a number of environment variables to control build,
installation and operation. While PDO should build and run with only the
default values, some configuration may be required. A list of commonly
used environment variables is available [here](environment.md).

## Docker Installation

Docker provides the easiest way to install and run PDO. It allows you to
develop easily on a variety of systems and isolates all package
installations from the host. Further, it simplifies end-to-end setup
with a local Sawtooth ledger. Instructions for installation with docker are available
[here](docker.md).

## Host System Installation

While the docker installation simplifies installation and execution,
sometimes it is helpful to have more control over the
process. Instructions for host system installation are available
[here](host_install.md).

**Note:** If the installation of PSW (and kernel driver) was successful, you should have a running PSW daemon (aesm_service) which you can confirm by running `systemctl status aesmd.service`.

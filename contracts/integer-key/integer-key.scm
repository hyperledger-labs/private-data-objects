;; -----------------------------------------------------------------
;; NAME: escrow
;;
;; DESCRIPTION: place a counter in escrow to a given identity; the
;; counter will be marked inactive. Note that this method changes the
;; state of a counter but does not return an escrow attestion since the
;; state change in this function must be committed first.
;;
;; PARAMETERS:
;;   key -- counter identifier
;;   agent-public-key -- the public key of the owner of the escrow
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------

    (send counter 'deactivate agent-public-key)
    #t))

;; -----------------------------------------------------------------
;; NAME: escrow-attestation
;;
;; DESCRIPTION: generate an attestation that a counter has
;; been escrowed; this is distinct from the actual escrow in order
;; to ensure that the state change is committed to the ledger
;;
;; PARAMETERS:
;;   key -- counter identifier
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------

;; DESCRIPTION: exchange the ownership of two counters that have been

;; provides permission for the exchange in the signature
;;
;; PARAMETERS:
;;   key1 -- counter identifier
;;   key2 -- counter identifier

A "contract" is, at its core, just some code. This code runs
inside the contract enclave where it is protected from eavesdropping
(confidentiality) and tampering (integrity). The contracts themselves enforce
what they can and can not do - they are just code that runs on data.

This distribution includes two contract interpreters:
- [Wawaka](wawaka.md) -- A WASM-based interpreter

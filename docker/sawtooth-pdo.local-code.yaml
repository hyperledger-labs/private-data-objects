# This docker-compose file extends the basic sawtooth-pdo template with support
# to build from code _committed_ to workspace.
# To use add a '-f sawtooth-pdo.local-code.yaml' _after_ the
# '-f sawtooth-pdo.yaml'. This can also be combined with sawooth-pdo.sgx.yaml.
# To get latest code, you might want to run 'docker-compose .... build' before
# running 'docker-compose ... up'

# Note: a similar approach can aus be used for other epos and/or branches.
# if not a local repo you can drop the context: and volumes: parts.  If your
# repo requires authentication such as SSH authentication this will work easily
# though only with docker version 18.09+ (look for --secret/--ssh parameters)

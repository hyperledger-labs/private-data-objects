# This docker-compose file extends the basic sawtooth-pdo template with support
# for SGX in hardware mode. To use add a '-f sawtooth-pdo.sgx.yaml' _after_ the
# '-f sawtooth-pdo.yaml'. This can also be combined with sawtooth-pdo.local-code.yaml.

# Before you can run the containers in hardware mode, you will have to prepare following
# files in the sgx subdirectory
# - sgx_spid.txt
# - sgx_spid_api_key.txt
# - sgx_ias_key.pem
# See 'build/common-config -h' for information on the content of these files
#
# in the pdo-build shell (see sawtooth-pdo.yaml), before doing any operation
# you also will have to register sgx-related information in the ledger with
# following steps
#    export PDO_SGX_KEY_ROOT=/project/pdo/build/opt/pdo/etc/keys/sgx/
#    unset PDO_SPID PDO_SPID_API_KEY
#    source /project/pdo/src/private-data-objects/build/common-config.sh
#    make -C /project/pdo/src/private-data-objects/build conf register

# Use this docker-compose file together with sawtoth-pdo.yaml (and other extensions)
# if you run behind a proxy and have the corresponding environment variables http_proxy
# https_proxy and no_proxy defined
# Note: for vanilla docker >=17.07 you can define proxy in ~/.docker/config.json
# (see https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/) but this seems to be ignored by
# docker-compose installed in docker-compose versions in ubuntu 18.04. Later
# versions, e.g., the one in 20.04, will honor that and will make this file obsolete ..

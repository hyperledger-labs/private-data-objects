# This docker-compose file starts a complete end-to-end environment for PDO/CCF with 
# sgx in simulator mode. The code used are the main branch for pdo. For CCF,
# we use version 0.11.7.  
#
# To use, define the env host_ip (= host_ip_address) & do the following
# - build base pdo-dev image (see docker/Dockerfile.pdo-dev for build-time options ..)
#    docker build docker -f Dockerfile.pdo-dev -t pdo-dev
# If you are behind proxy, ensure that proxy is defined in ~/.docker/config.json for the above command to work
# - build docker-composed images (here and below with additional -f options as mentioned above)
#    docker-compose -f ccf-pdo.yaml build
# If you are behind proxy, use docker-compose -f ccf-pdo.yaml -f ccf-pdo.proxy.yaml build. 
# ~/.docker/config.json does not work with docker-compose. Continue to add the ccf-pdo.proxy.yaml for the rest of the
# docker-compose commands as well.
# - start up enviroment. This will instantiate the ccf ledger as well
#    docker-compose -f ccf-pdo.yaml up
# - start shell on pdo-build
#   docker-compose  -f ccf-pdo.yaml exec pdo-build bash
# - in that shell run tests (e.g., /project/pdo/src/private-data-objects/build/__tools__/run-tests.sh )
#   or start ehs/ps, run contracts and have fun ... :-)
#   - for automated tests, you also just might call 'docker-compose  -f ccf-pdo.yaml exec pdo-build bash -i -c /project/pdo/src/private-data-objects/build/__tools__/run-tests.sh'
# - ....
